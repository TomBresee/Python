Our Technical Approach
========================

- **All input sequenced files will be .VCF format (or .BAM)**
   - Standard file format for DNA sequenced files


=====   ===========
File    Description
=====   ===========
VCF     VCF stands for Variant Call Format. It is a standardized text file format for representing SNP, INDEL, SV and CNV variation calls. SNPs (Single Sucleotide Polymorphisms, pronounced “snips”), are the most common type of genetic variation among people. Each SNP represents a difference in a single DNA building block, called a nucleotide. This is the most used VCF.

BAM     Binary Alignment Map (BAM) is the comprehensive raw data of genome sequencing; it consists of the lossless, compressed binary representation of the Sequence Alignment Map. BAM files are 90-100 gigabytes in size. They are generated by aligning the FASTQ files to the reference genome.

FASTQ   FASTQ files contain billions of entries and are about 90-100 gigabytes in size.  Truly raw data.           
=====   ===========  


 Note:  VCF files include SNPs, INDELs, CNV and SV


- **Minimize shuffles !**
   -  Spark shuffles will call to io process, so we try to avoid  

- **Misc**
   -  Focus on defining workload behavior
   -  Avro and Parquet for data models and file formats !
